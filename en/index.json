Through the cross-modal interaction, we can get more comprehensive emotional characteristics of the speaker. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is an efficient pre-trained language representation model. Fine-tuning it has obtained new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks like question answering and natural language inference. However, most previous works fine-tune BERT only base on text data, how to learn a better representation by introducing the multimodal information is still worth exploring. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Modal BERT (CM-BERT), which relies on the interaction of text and audio modality to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model. As the core unit of the CM-BERT, masked multimodal attention is designed to dynamically adjust the weight of words by combining the information of text and audio modality. We evaluate our method on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results show that it has significantly improved the performance on all the metrics over previous baselines and text-only finetuning of BERT. Besides, we visualize the masked multimodal attention and proves that it can reasonably adjust the weight of words by introducing audio modality information.","tags":[],"title":"CM-BERT: Cross-Modal BERT for Text-Audio Sentiment Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huadong Li","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"65a5fe0a5ee8edf5aab919f2eac8fdfa","permalink":"https://thuiar.mfy.world/en/publication/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-robust-emotional-classification-in-facial-expression-recognition/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-robust-emotional-classification-in-facial-expression-recognition/","section":"publication","summary":"For emotion classification in facial expression recognition (FER), the performance of both traditional statistical methods and state-of-the-art deep learning methods are highly dependent on the quality of data. Traditional methods use image preprocessing (such as smoothing and segmentation) to improve image quality. However, the results still fail to meet the quality requirements of the emotion classifiers in FER. To address the above issues, this paper proposed a novel framework based on reinforcement learning for pre-selecting useful images(RLPS) for emotion classification in FER, which is made up of two modules: image selector and rough emotion classifier. Image selector is used to select useful images for emotion classification through reinforcement strategy and rough emotion classifier acts as a teacher to train image selector. Our framework improves classification performance by improving the quality of the dataset and can be applied to any classifier. Experiment results on RAF-DB, ExpW, and FER2013 datasets show that the proposed strategy achieves consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art emotion classification methods in FER","tags":[],"title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Emotional Classification in Facial Expression Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu","Jiyun Zou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"88c292635c82e75a0782bf542017692d","permalink":"https://thuiar.mfy.world/en/publication/hgfm/","publishdate":"2019-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/hgfm/","section":"publication","summary":"To solve the problem of poor classification performance of multiple complex emotions in acoustic modalities, we propose a hierarchical grained and feature model (HGFM). The frame-level and utterance-level structures of acoustic samples are processed by the recurrent neural network. The model includes a frame-level representation module with before and after information, a utterance-level representation module with context information, and a different level acoustic feature fusion module. We take the output of frame-level structure as the input of utterance-level structure and extract the acoustic features of these two levels respectively for effective and complementary fusion. Experiments show that the proposed HGFM has better accuracy and robustness. By this method, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.","tags":[],"title":"HGFM: A Hierarchical Grained and Feature Model for Acoustic Emotion Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhijing Wu","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"3167acc98ad4edf09bf7f9a7a2fe5049","permalink":"https://thuiar.mfy.world/en/publication/improving-the-robustness-of-machine-reading-comprehension-model-with-hierarchical-knowledge-and-auxiliary-unanswerability-prediction/","publishdate":"2019-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/improving-the-robustness-of-machine-reading-comprehension-model-with-hierarchical-knowledge-and-auxiliary-unanswerability-prediction/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) aims to understand a passage and answer a series of related questions. With the development of deep learning and the release of large-scale MRC datasets, many end-to-end MRC neural networks have achieved remarkable success. However, these models are fragile and lack of robustness when there are some imperceptible adversarial perturbations in the input. In this paper, we propose an MRC model which has two main components to improve the robustness. On the one hand, we enhance the representation of the model by leveraging hierarchical knowledge from external knowledge bases. On the other hand, we introduce an auxiliary unanswerability prediction module and perform supervised multi-task learning along with a span prediction task. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model can achieve consistent improvement compared with other strong baselines.","tags":[],"title":"Improving the Robustness of Machine Reading Comprehension Model with Hierarchical Knowledge and Auxiliary Unanswerability Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenmeng Yu","Hua Xu","Fanyang Meng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594538644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594538644,"objectID":"c8c941131fbf6a3d92f09b21b261513a","permalink":"https://thuiar.mfy.world/en/publication/chsims/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/chsims/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies in multimodal sentiment analysis have used limited datasets, which only contain unified multimodal annotations. However, the unified annotations do not always reflect the independent sentiment of single modalities and limit the model to capture the difference between modalities. In this paper, we introduce a Chinese single- and multi-modal sentiment analysis dataset, CH-SIMS, which contains 2,281 refined video segments in the wild with both multimodal and independent unimodal annotations. It allows researchers to study the interaction between modalities or use independent unimodal annotations for unimodal sentiment analysis.Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning framework based on late fusion as the baseline. Extensive experiments on the CH-SIMS show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance and learn more distinctive unimodal representations. The full dataset and codes are available for use at https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA.","tags":[],"title":"CH-SIMS: A Chinese Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Dataset with Fine-grained Annotation of Modality","type":"publication"}]
