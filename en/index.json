sentiment analysis is an emerging research field that aims to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and express emotion. Through the cross-modal interaction, we can get more comprehensive emotional characteristics of the speaker. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is an efficient pre-trained language representation model. Fine-tuning it has obtained new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks like question answering and natural language inference. However, most previous works fine-tune BERT only base on text data, how to learn a better representation by introducing the multimodal information is still worth exploring. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Modal BERT (CM-BERT), which relies on the interaction of text and audio modality to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model. As the core unit of the CM-BERT, masked multimodal attention is designed to dynamically adjust the weight of words by combining the information of text and audio modality. We evaluate our method on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results show that it has significantly improved the performance on all the metrics over previous baselines and text-only finetuning of BERT. Besides, we visualize the masked multimodal attention and proves that it can reasonably adjust the weight of words by introducing audio modality information.","tags":[],"title":"CM-BERT: Cross-Modal BERT for Text-Audio Sentiment Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu","Jia Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"ac11537788b44797f532b5c2b0333204","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/publication/a-joint-model-of-extended-lda-and-ibtm-over-streaming-chinese-short-texts/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/a-joint-model-of-extended-lda-and-ibtm-over-streaming-chinese-short-texts/","section":"publication","summary":"With the prevalent of short texts, discovering the topics within them has become an important task. Biterm Topic Model (BTM) is more suitable to discover topics on short texts than traditional topic models. However, there are still some challenges that dealing short texts with BTM will always ignore the document-topic semantic information and lack the true intentions of users. In addition, it is a static method and can not manage streaming short texts when a new one arrives immediately. In order to keep document-topic information and get the topic distribution of a new short text at once, we propose a joint model based on online algorithms of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BTM, which combines the merits of both models. Not only does it alleviate the sparsity when addressing short texts with the online algorithm of BTM, namely Incremental Biterm Topic Model (IBTM), but also keeps document-topic information with extended LDA. And considering the differences between English and Chinese text in writing, we use combined words in short texts as key words to extend the length of short texts and keep the true intensions of users. As shown in the experiment results on two real world datasets, our method is better than other baseline methods.

In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm based on a new dominance relation is proposed for many-objective optimization. The proposed evolutionary algorithm aims to enhance the convergence of the recently suggested nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III by exploiting the fitness evaluation scheme in the MOEA based on decomposition, but still inherit the strength of the former in diversity maintenance. In the proposed algorithm, the nondominated sorting scheme based on the introduced new dominance relation is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, ensuring both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark problems having 3-15 objectives and compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can work well on almost all the test functions considered in this paper, and it is compared favorably with the other many-objective optimizers.

However, due to the nature of contour lines for the adopted aggregation functions, they usually fail to preserve the diversity in high-dimensional objective space even by using diverse weight vectors. To address this problem, we propose to maintain the desired diversity of solutions in their evolutionary process explicitly by exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in the objective space, which achieves better balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. The idea is implemented to enhance two well-performing decomposition-based algorithms, i.e., MOEA, based on decomposition and ensemble fitness ranking. The two enhanced algorithms are compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms and a series of comparative experiments are conducted on a number of test problems from two well-known test suites. The experimental results show that the two proposed algorithms are generally more effective than their predecessors in balancing convergence and diversity, and they are also very competitive against other existing algorithms for solving many-objective optimization problems.","tags":[],"title":"Balancing Convergence and Diversity in Decomposition-Based Many-Objective Optimizers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huadong Li","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"65a5fe0a5ee8edf5aab919f2eac8fdfa","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/publication/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-robust-emotional-classification-in-facial-expression-recognition/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-robust-emotional-classification-in-facial-expression-recognition/","section":"publication","summary":"For emotion classification in facial expression recognition (FER), the performance of both traditional statistical methods and state-of-the-art deep learning methods are highly dependent on the quality of data. Traditional methods use image preprocessing (such as smoothing and segmentation) to improve image quality. However, the results still fail to meet the quality requirements of the emotion classifiers in FER. To address the above issues, this paper proposed a novel framework based on reinforcement learning for pre-selecting useful images(RLPS) for emotion classification in FER, which is made up of two modules: image selector and rough emotion classifier. Image selector is used to select useful images for emotion classification through reinforcement strategy and rough emotion classifier acts as a teacher to train image selector. Our framework improves classification performance by improving the quality of the dataset and can be applied to any classifier.

Much recent research in short text becomes increasingly significant, such as topic inference for short text. Biterm topic model (BTM) benefits from the word co-occurrence patterns of the corpus, which makes it perform better than conventional topic models in uncovering latent semantic relevance for short text. However, BTM resorts to Gibbs sampling to infer topics, which is very time consuming, especially for large-scale datasets or when the number of topics is extremely large. It requires O(K) operations per sample for K topics, where K denotes the number of topics in the corpus. In this paper, we propose an acceleration algorithm of BTM, FastBTM, using an efficient sampling method for BTM, which converges much faster than BTM without degrading topic quality. FastBTM is based on Metropolis-Hastings and alias method, both of which have been widely adopted in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and achieved outstanding speedup. Our FastBTM can effectively reduce the sampling complexity of biterm topic model from O(K) to O(1) amortized time. We carry out a number of experiments on three datasets including two short text datasets, Tweets2011 Collection dataset and Yahoo! Answers dataset, and one long document dataset, Enron dataset.

With the development of deep learning and the release of large-scale MRC datasets, many end-to-end MRC neural networks have achieved remarkable success. However, these models are fragile and lack of robustness when there are some imperceptible adversarial perturbations in the input. In this paper, we propose an MRC model which has two main components to improve the robustness. On the one hand, we enhance the representation of the model by leveraging hierarchical knowledge from external knowledge bases. On the other hand, we introduce an auxiliary unanswerability prediction module and perform supervised multi-task learning along with a span prediction task.

Objective reduction can alleviate such difficulties by removing the redundant objectives in the original objective set, which has become one of the most important techniques in many-objective optimization. In this paper, we suggest to view objective reduction as a multiobjective search problem and introduce three multiobjective formulations of the problem, where the first two formulations are both based on preservation of the dominance structure and the third one utilizes the correlation between objectives. For each multiobjective formulation, a multiobjective objective reduction algorithm is proposed by employing the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II to generate a Pareto front of nondominated objective subsets that can offer decision support to the user. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of two major categories of objective reduction approaches based on several theorems, with the aim of revealing their strengths and limitations. Lastly, the performance of the proposed multiobjective algorithms is studied extensively on various benchmark problems and two real-world problems. Numerical results and comparisons are then shown to highlight the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multiobjective algorithms over existing state-of-the-art approaches in the related field.","tags":[],"title":"Objective Reduction in Many-Objective Optimization: Evolutionary Multiobjective Approaches and Comprehensive Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenmeng Yu","Hua Xu","Fanyang Meng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594538644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594538644,"objectID":"c8c941131fbf6a3d92f09b21b261513a","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/publication/chsims/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/chsims/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies in multimodal sentiment analysis have used limited datasets, which only contain unified multimodal annotations.

It allows researchers to study the interaction between modalities or use independent unimodal annotations for unimodal sentiment analysis.Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning framework based on late fusion as the baseline.

However, it is hard to get satisfying clustering results since the definition of intents is strongly guided by prior knowledge. Existing methods incorporate prior knowledge by intensive feature engineering, which not only leads to overfitting but also makes it sensitive to the number of clusters. In this paper, we propose constrained deep adaptive clustering with cluster refinement (CDAC+), an end-to-end clustering method that can naturally incorporate pairwise constraints as prior knowledge to guide the clustering process. Moreover, we refine the clusters by forcing the model to learn from the high confidence assignments. After eliminating low confidence assignments, our approach is surprisingly insensitive to the number of clusters. Experimental results on the three benchmark datasets show that our method can yield significant improvements over strong baselines.","tags":[],"title":"Discovering New Intents via Constrained Deep Adaptive Clustering with Cluster Refinement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxiang Xie","Hua Xu","Congcong Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567236244,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567236244,"objectID":"d9772fcbba83c5a10407a3b1f722685d","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/publication/multi-channel-convolutional-neural-networks-with-adversarial-training-for-few-shot-relation-classification/","publishdate":"2019-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/multi-channel-convolutional-neural-networks-with-adversarial-training-for-few-shot-relation-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"The distant supervised (DS) method has improved the performance of relation classification (RC) by means of extending the dataset.

The service has gained worldwide popularity since it was created in March 2006, with more than 316 million monthly active users in June 2015 who posted 500 million tweets per day. As the number of available tweets grows, the problem of managing tweets becomes extremely difficult, which could lead to information overload. To avoid this problem, people use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase in their tweets to categorize those tweets and help them show more easily in each Twitter search. Furthermore, hashtags can be used to collect public opinions on events and their ideas at the individual, community or even the world level. Incorporating hashtags to obtain better performance such as sentiment classification and breaking events detection also has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. However, there are very few tweets containing hashtags, which impedes the quality of search results and their further usage in various applications. Therefore, hashtag recommendation has become a particularly important research problem. In this paper, we first propose a novel model, namely online Twitter-User LDA to learn Twitter users’ dynamic interests. Then considering the shortness, sparsity, and high volume of tweets, we introduce an effective method to discover the latent topics of streaming tweet content, which uses recently proposed incremental biterm topic model (IBTM). We finally design an automatic hashtag recommendation method called User-IBTM by combining the online Twitter-User LDA and IBTM. As shown in the experimental results on real world data from Twitter, our design method based on dynamic user interests and streaming tweet content significantly outperforms several other baseline methods and can suggest more precise hashtags.","tags":[],"title":"Suggest what to tag: Recommending more precise hashtags based on users’ dynamic interests and streaming tweet content","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer: Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2016 - Today\n","date":1451577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451577600,"objectID":"050eb509d73d451227a478cbd25c314e","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/intelligent-mobile-robot/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/intelligent-mobile-robot/","section":"talk","summary":"Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Intelligent Mobile Robot: Design, Programming and Practice","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer: Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Graduate and Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2013 - Today\n","date":1356969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356969600,"objectID":"e7d4ecfaf4b1f29cd65dd9ec01f1f6ad","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/industrial-data-mining/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/industrial-data-mining/","section":"talk","summary":"Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Industrial Data Mining","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer: Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2011 - Today\n","date":1293811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293811200,"objectID":"3e7631952ecff1e05471581a1af8e97d","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/data-mining-method-and-application/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/data-mining-method-and-application/","section":"talk","summary":"Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Data Mining: Methods and Applications","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Tsinghua University Computer Department Undergraduate Professional Basic Course\nLecturer：Junhui Deng\nTarget Audience: Computer Science Undergraduate\nTeaching Time：2001 - 2006\n","date":978278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978278400,"objectID":"b7caabb0e4bde45ecc0519114b6a051c","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/data-structure-cs/","publishdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/data-structure-cs/","section":"talk","summary":"Tsinghua University Computer Department Undergraduate Professional Basic Course","tags":[],"title":"Data Strcture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer：Junhui Deng\nTarget Audience: All Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2002 - Today\n","date":978278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978278400,"objectID":"970c56d891d3e1abdca0aaf1b5140c8d","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/data-structure/","publishdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/data-structure/","section":"talk","summary":"National Excellent Course, Public Elective Course of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Data Strcture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng","Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Tsinghua University Computer Department Graduate Basic Theory Course\nLecturer：Junhui Deng, Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Graduate Students\nTeaching Time：1997 - Today\n","date":852048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":852048000,"objectID":"f93308c8be1670e9b2dc795f64282a4a","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/en/talk/computational-geometry/","publishdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/computational-geometry/","section":"talk","summary":"Tsinghua University Computer Department Graduate Basic Theory Course","tags":[],"title":"Computational Geometry","type":"talk"}]
